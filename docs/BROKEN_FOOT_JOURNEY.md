# OHIP Forward: Complete Broken Foot Treatment Journey

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step walkthrough of how OHIP Forward handles a patient with a suspected broken foot, from initial complaint through complete recovery. This demonstrates the platform's end-to-end AI-coordinated healthcare delivery capabilities.

---

## The Complete 12-Step Journey

### Step 1: Initial Complaint - Patient Opens App

**Patient Action:**
- Patient opens OHIP Forward mobile app or web portal
- Types into chat: *"My foot really hurts after I fell"*

**System Response:**
- Authentication via OHIP card number or biometric
- Creates new care session
- Initializes AI interview state machine

**Technical Flow:**
```
POST /api/v1/chat/start
{
  "patientId": "P123456",
  "initialMessage": "My foot really hurts after I fell"
}

Response:
{
  "sessionId": "CS-789012",
  "status": "interview_started",
  "nextQuestion": "I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about when this happened?"
}
```

---

### Step 2: AI Interview - Targeted Question Sequence

**AI Interview Questions (Sequential):**

1. **When did the injury occur?**
   - *Patient: "About 2 hours ago"*
   - System records: `injury_time: "2_hours_ago"`

2. **How did you fall? What were you doing?**
   - *Patient: "I slipped on ice while walking to my car"*
   - System records: `mechanism: "slip_fall", surface: "ice"`

3. **On a scale of 1-10, how severe is your pain right now?**
   - *Patient: "It's about an 8 out of 10"*
   - System records: `pain_level: 8`

4. **Can you put any weight on your foot at all?**
   - *Patient: "No, I can't walk on it"*
   - System records: `weight_bearing: false` → **Ottawa Ankle Rules: HIGH RISK**

5. **Is there any swelling or bruising?**
   - *Patient: "Yes, it's very swollen and starting to bruise"*
   - System records: `swelling: true, bruising: true`

6. **Can you point your toes or move your ankle?**
   - *Patient: "It hurts too much to move it"*
   - System records: `range_of_motion: "severely_limited"`

7. **Any numbness or tingling in your toes?**
   - *Patient: "No, I can feel everything"*
   - System records: `neurovascular_intact: true`

8. **Do you have any medical conditions or take blood thinners?**
   - *Patient: "No medical conditions, no medications"*
   - System records: `comorbidities: null, anticoagulants: false`

**Technical Flow:**
```
POST /api/v1/triage
{
  "symptoms": ["foot pain", "unable to bear weight", "swelling", "bruising"],
  "mechanism": "fall_on_ice",
  "duration": "2 hours",
  "severity": "severe",
  "painLevel": 8,
  "patientId": "P123456",
  "patientAge": 35,
  "additionalInfo": {
    "weightBearing": false,
    "swelling": true,
    "bruising": true,
    "neurovascularIntact": true
  }
}
```

---

### Step 3: AI Assessment - Clinical Decision Support

**AI Processing:**

1. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Symptom cluster: foot trauma + unable to bear weight + swelling
   - Mechanism: high-energy fall
   - Ottawa Ankle Rules criteria: MET (inability to bear weight = X-ray required)

2. **Differential Diagnosis (Ranked by probability):**
   - Metatarsal fracture: 45%
   - Ankle fracture: 30%
   - Severe sprain (Ligament tear): 20%
   - Soft tissue contusion: 5%

3. **Urgency Classification:**
   - Level: **URGENT** (not emergency)
   - Rationale: Likely fracture, neurovascular intact, no open wound
   - Timeframe: X-ray required within 4 hours

4. **Care Pathway Selection:**
   - Pathway: `ORTHOPEDIC_TRAUMA_PATHWAY`
   - Required tests: [X-ray foot/ankle (3 views)]
   - Specialist referral: Orthopedic consult if fracture confirmed

**System Output:**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "CS-789012",
  "assessment": {
    "urgency": "urgent",
    "confidence": 0.92,
    "primaryDiagnosis": "Suspected foot/ankle fracture",
    "differentials": [
      {"condition": "Metatarsal fracture", "probability": 0.45},
      {"condition": "Ankle fracture", "probability": 0.30},
      {"condition": "Severe ligament sprain", "probability": 0.20},
      {"condition": "Soft tissue contusion", "probability": 0.05}
    ],
    "clinicalReasoning": "Ottawa Ankle Rules positive: unable to bear weight. High mechanism injury with immediate swelling and bruising suggests fracture. Neurovascular status intact - no emergency escalation needed.",
    "recommendedAction": "X-ray imaging required within 4 hours. Orthopedic evaluation if fracture confirmed.",
    "carePathway": "ORTHOPEDIC_TRAUMA_PATHWAY"
  }
}
```

---

### Step 4: Automated Scheduling - X-ray Requisition & Booking

**AI Scheduling Logic:**

1. **Generate Requisition:**
   ```json
   {
     "requisitionId": "REQ-445566",
     "testType": "X-ray",
     "bodyPart": "foot_ankle_right",
     "views": ["AP", "lateral", "oblique"],
     "priority": "urgent",
     "clinicalIndication": "Suspected fracture, unable to bear weight post-fall",
     "orderingProvider": "AI_TRIAGE_SYSTEM",
     "authorizingPhysician": "Dr. Virtual Supervisor",
     "validUntil": "2024-01-15T18:00:00Z"
   }
   ```

2. **Find Available Imaging Centers:**
   - Query radius: 15 km from patient location
   - Filter: X-ray capability, urgent slots available, OHIP-approved
   - Sort by: distance + wait time + patient preferences

3. **Present Options to Patient:**
   ```json
   {
     "availableSlots": [
       {
         "facilityId": "IMG-001",
         "facilityName": "Toronto General Hospital Imaging",
         "address": "200 Elizabeth St, Toronto, ON",

   {
     "analysisId": "AI-XRAY-112233",
     "studyId": "STUDY-998877",
     "aiFindings": {
       "fractureDetected": true,
       "confidence": 0.94,
       "location": "5th metatarsal base (Jones fracture)",
       "severity": "complete_fracture",
       "displacement": "minimal (<2mm)",
       "angulation": "none",
       "additionalFindings": [
         "No ankle fracture detected",
         "No dislocation",
         "Soft tissue swelling visible"
       ],
       "recommendedAction": "Orthopedic consultation required. Non-weight bearing. Immobilization.",
       "urgencyEscalation": false
     },
     "heatmapUrl": "https://storage.ohipforward.ca/ai-analysis/AI-XRAY-112233/heatmap.png"
   }
   ```

4. **Automatic Escalation to Radiologist:**
   - All AI-positive findings flagged for human review
   - Assigned to on-call radiologist
   - SLA: 30-minute review for urgent cases

**Radiologist Review (1:30 PM - 1:45 PM):**

```
Radiologist Portal Access:

### Step 11: Recovery Monitoring - Continuous AI Oversight

**Daily Check-Ins (Automated SMS/Push):**

**Week 1 (Daily):**
```
Day 1: "How is your pain today? (1-10)"
       → Patient: "7"
       → System: "That's expected. Take your medications as prescribed. Elevate and ice."

Day 3: "Any numbness, tingling, or color changes in your toes?"
       → Patient: "No, everything feels normal"
       → System: "Great! That's a good sign. Continue non-weight bearing."

Day 5: "How well are you managing with the crutches?"
       → Patient: "Getting better, but my arms are sore"
       → System: "Common! Make sure crutch height is correct. Video tutorial: [link]"
```

**Week 2-3 (Every 2 days):**
```
"Pain level today?"
"Are you keeping weight off the foot?"
"Any swelling or increased redness?"
"Taking medications as prescribed?"
```

**Week 4+ (Weekly):**
```
"Ready for your follow-up X-ray next week?"
"Have you started putting gentle weight on the foot?"
"How is physical therapy going?"
```

**AI Monitoring System:**
```javascript
// Automated escalation logic
if (painLevel > 8 && increasing) {
  → Alert: Flag for nurse review
}

if (swelling_reported === "worse" && redness === "increased") {
  → Alert: Possible infection - urgent provider contact
  → Automated call scheduled within 2 hours
}

if (medication_adherence < 70%) {
  → Reminder: Medication importance education sent
}

if (appointment_no_show) {
  → Automated rebooking offered
  → Outreach: "We missed you today. Everything okay?"
}
```

**Medication Compliance Tracking:**
```
Push notifications:
- 8:00 AM: "Time for your morning Ibuprofen"
- 2:00 PM: "Afternoon Ibuprofen dose"
- 8:00 PM: "Evening Ibuprofen dose"

Patient confirms in app → tracked in system
Missed doses → gentle reminder 30 minutes later
```

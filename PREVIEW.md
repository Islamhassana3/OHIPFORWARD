# OHIPFORWARD UI/Frontend Preview Guide

## üé® Overview

This document provides instructions for previewing the OHIPFORWARD healthcare coordination system's user interface.

## üöÄ Quick Start - Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+ installed
- npm package manager

### Starting the Frontend

#### Option 1: Using the Preview Script (Recommended)
The easiest way to start the application with automatic port detection:

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
./scripts/preview.sh
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
scripts\preview.bat
```

The script will:
- Automatically install dependencies if needed
- Find an available port (starting from 3000)
- Start the development server
- Open the application in your browser

#### Option 2: Manual Start

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies (if not already installed):**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server:**
```bash
npm start
```

The application will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or prompt you if port 3000 is in use)

## üîß Backend Integration

### With Backend Running

To get full functionality including live triage results:

1. **Start the backend server:**
```bash
# From the project root
python src/main.py
```

2. **Verify backend is running:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health
```

3. **Start the frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Without Backend (Demo Mode)

The frontend includes fallback data for demonstration:
- **Providers page**: Shows 4 sample healthcare providers
- **Triage page**: Form is functional but requires backend for results
- All other pages work fully without backend

## üì¶ Production Build

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be in the `frontend/build/` directory and can be served with any static file server:

```bash
# Install serve globally (if not already installed)
npm install -g serve

# Serve the build
serve -s build
```

## üåê Deployment Options

### Static Hosting
- **Netlify**: Connect GitHub repo and deploy
- **Vercel**: Automatic deployment from GitHub
- **GitHub Pages**: Use `npm run build` and deploy build folder
- **AWS S3**: Upload build folder to S3 bucket

### With Backend
- **Docker**: Use docker-compose for full stack
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP, Azure with container services
- **Heroku**: Deploy frontend and backend separately

## üîó Preview Access

### Local Development
- **Main URL**: `http://localhost:3000` (or next available port if 3000 is in use)
- **Network URL**: Available on local network (shown when starting dev server)

### Port Configuration
The preview scripts **always** automatically detect and use an available port starting from 3000. This ensures that the preview will never fail due to port conflicts. If port 3000 is already in use (e.g., by another application), the script will automatically find and use the next available port (3001, 3002, etc., up to 3100).

**Automatic port detection runs every time** to guarantee a free port is always available, preventing any conflicts with other applications or services.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

### Browser DevTools
- React DevTools extension recommended
- Network tab for API monitoring
- Console for debugging

### Hot Reload
The development server includes hot module replacement - changes are reflected immediately without full page reload.
